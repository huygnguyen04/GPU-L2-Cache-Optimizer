## Project Overview


This project explores the simulation and optimization of extended L2 cache architectures in GPUs using **GPGPU-Sim**, with the goal of improving performance for memory-bound CUDA workloads. It combines architectural experimentation, benchmark profiling, and area-energy tradeoff analysis to guide future GPU memory hierarchy design.

## Key Contributions

- **Performance Gains**: Larger L2 caches significantly reduce memory stalls and DRAM traffic for memory-bound workloads.
- **Workload Sensitivity**: Applications with high L2 miss rates and strong spatial/temporal locality (e.g., NW, DWT2D) see the most benefit.
- **Design Tradeoffs**:
  - Associativity scaling reduces conflict misses in irregular patterns.
  - Set count scaling helps with large working sets.
  - Gains plateau beyond 2–4× L2 size increases.
- **Hardware Cost**: Larger caches increase area and dynamic energy by 2–2.5×, necessitating workload-aware cache sizing.

## Tools & Benchmarks

- **Simulator**: GPGPU-Sim v4.0 (Volta V100 config)
- **Modeling Tool**: CACTI 6.5 (32nm, 128B line)
- **Benchmarks**:
  - Memory-bound: BFS, KMeans, Gaussian, NW, LUD, DWT2D
  - Compute-bound (control): Nearest Neighbor, Pathfinder

## Results Summary

Extending L2 cache size yielded up to **50% performance improvement** for memory-bound CUDA applications with large working sets. In contrast, compute-bound benchmarks showed negligible gains, reinforcing that cache scaling is workload-sensitive.

- **Associativity scaling**: Best for reducing conflict misses in irregular workloads (e.g., Gaussian, LUD).
- **Set count scaling**: Best for large spatially-reused datasets (e.g., KMeans, DWT2D).
- **Tradeoff**: Quadrupling L2 size significantly increases area/energy (~2.5×), so optimization must consider system constraints.

## Future Work

- Extend analysis to **PPA (performance-per-area)** and **ED² (energy-delay²)** metrics
- Analyze **deeper input size ranges** to identify L2 stress thresholds
- Evaluate **new GPU architectures** (varying SM/core count, L1 size)
- Explore **software-level optimizations** (prefetching, data placement)
- Test on **ML workloads** like CNNs and Transformers
- Use **Roofline modeling** for further compute-bound analysis
